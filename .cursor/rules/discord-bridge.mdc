# Discord Bridge - Response Mirroring

You are connected to a Discord bridge. The developer monitors your work via Discord and expects to see your responses there.

## CRITICAL: Forward Cursor Prompts to Discord (EVERY MESSAGE)

**For EVERY user message that does NOT contain `[Discord Thread:`, you MUST forward it to Discord.**

This applies to ALL messages from Cursor throughout the conversation, not just the first one. Users can switch between Cursor and Discord mid-conversation.

### How to detect message origin:
- Messages from **Discord** contain `[Discord Thread:` at the start → do NOT forward
- Messages from **Cursor** do NOT contain this prefix → MUST forward

### When to forward:
- Check the **most recent user message** for the `[Discord Thread:` prefix
- If NO prefix: call `mcp_discord-bridge_forward_user_prompt` BEFORE doing any work
- If prefix present: do NOT forward (it came from Discord, they already see it)

**This is NOT optional.** Without forwarding, the developer monitoring Discord has no context about what you're working on.

## CRITICAL: Mirror Your COMPLETE Responses to Discord

**After every response you give, post the FULL content to Discord using `mcp_discord-bridge_post_to_thread`.**

This creates a mirrored experience where the developer can follow along in Discord without needing to be in Cursor. **Do NOT summarize or shorten your responses for Discord.** The developer should receive the exact same information in both places.

### How to Mirror (IMPORTANT: Get Thread ID First!)

**At the very start of your response**, call `mcp_discord-bridge_get_my_thread_id` EXACTLY ONCE to get your Discord thread ID. Store this ID and use it for ALL Discord operations:

1. Call `mcp_discord-bridge_get_my_thread_id` → returns your thread_id (CALL ONLY ONCE at conversation start!)
2. Check the **most recent message** for `[Discord Thread:` prefix
3. If NO prefix (message from Cursor): call `mcp_discord-bridge_forward_user_prompt`
4. Call `mcp_discord-bridge_start_typing` with the thread_id
5. Do your work
6. Call `mcp_discord-bridge_post_to_thread` with the thread_id and your FULL response

**IMPORTANT: Forward the prompt BEFORE starting typing.** Sending a message stops the typing indicator, so forwarding must come first.

**CRITICAL: NEVER call get_my_thread_id more than once per chat session.** Subsequent calls will return wrong thread IDs or hang for 5 seconds waiting for a thread that will never arrive. Store the thread_id and reuse it for the entire conversation.

**Why this matters:** There may be multiple AI agents running in parallel. Each agent claims a unique thread ID on first call. Calling again would claim a different thread.

### What to Post
- ✅ Your complete answers and explanations (NOT summarized)
- ✅ All code changes you made (full content, not summarized)
- ✅ Questions you're asking
- ✅ Status updates and progress
- ✅ Errors or blockers encountered
- ✅ Screenshots using `mcp_discord-bridge_send_file_to_thread`

### Discord Markdown Limitations

Discord supports a subset of markdown. When mirroring content:

**Supported in Discord:**
- Code blocks with triple backticks (including syntax highlighting)
- Bold, italic, strikethrough, underline
- Bullet lists and numbered lists
- Links
- Block quotes

**NOT supported in Discord (must be converted or omitted):**
- ❌ Tables - convert to plain text lists or formatted text
- ❌ Mermaid diagrams in code blocks - describe in text or omit the diagram
- ❌ Complex nested markdown structures

### Discord Newline Behavior (IMPORTANT)

Discord handles newlines differently than standard markdown:
- **Single newline = line break** in Discord (no need for double newlines)
- **Double newlines = extra blank line** (creates excessive whitespace)

When writing for Discord:
- Use single newlines between lines/paragraphs
- Only use double newlines when you intentionally want extra spacing
- This is the opposite of standard markdown where you need double newlines for paragraphs

### Handling Long Responses

Discord messages have a 2000 character limit. **Do NOT summarize to fit this limit.** Instead:

1. The tool will automatically split long messages at reasonable boundaries
2. Send the complete content and let it split into multiple messages
3. For very long code blocks, the tool handles splitting appropriately

### What NOT to Do
- ❌ Do NOT summarize long responses for Discord
- ❌ Do NOT shorten code examples
- ❌ Do NOT omit details that appear in Cursor
- ❌ Do NOT use tables in Discord messages (convert to lists)
- ❌ Do NOT include mermaid code blocks (describe in text instead)

## Available Tools

**mcp_discord-bridge_get_my_thread_id** - Get your Discord thread ID (call ONCE at start, NEVER again!)
**mcp_discord-bridge_forward_user_prompt** - Forward user's Cursor prompt to Discord (when message lacks [Discord Thread:] prefix)
**mcp_discord-bridge_post_to_thread** - Post your FULL response to Discord (every response)
**mcp_discord-bridge_send_file_to_thread** - Send screenshots, images, or files to Discord
**mcp_discord-bridge_start_typing** - Show typing indicator when starting work (pass thread_id!)
**mcp_discord-bridge_stop_typing** - Stop typing indicator (auto-stops on post)
**mcp_discord-bridge_check_discord_messages** - Check if the developer sent new instructions via Discord
**mcp_discord-bridge_create_conversation_thread** - Create a new thread for a different topic
**mcp_discord-bridge_rename_thread** - Rename the current thread to give it a more meaningful name
**mcp_discord-bridge_ask_question** - Ask a question with button options (ONLY when most recent message contains `[Discord Thread:`)

## CRITICAL: Choosing the Correct Ask Question Tool

**You MUST check the MOST RECENT user message before asking any question.**

Users can switch between Cursor and Discord mid-conversation. Check the **most recent user message** each time you need to ask a question - do NOT assume the user is still in the same place as earlier in the conversation.

### If the MOST RECENT message does NOT contain `[Discord Thread:` (user is in CURSOR):
- **USE the native `ask_question` tool**
- The user can see and interact with Cursor's native question UI
- Do NOT use `mcp_discord-bridge_ask_question` - they won't see it in time

### If the MOST RECENT message CONTAINS `[Discord Thread:` (user is in DISCORD):
- **USE `mcp_discord-bridge_ask_question`**
- The user cannot see Cursor's native question UI
- The Discord tool posts interactive buttons they can click

### Decision Rule (CHECK EVERY TIME YOU ASK A QUESTION):
- **No `[Discord Thread:` prefix in most recent message → Native `ask_question`**
- **Has `[Discord Thread:` prefix in most recent message → Discord `mcp_discord-bridge_ask_question`**

This is the same logic used for forwarding prompts - always check the most recent message, not earlier ones.

### Example (Discord user):
```
mcp_discord-bridge_ask_question({
  thread_id: "your_thread_id",
  question: "Which approach should I use?",
  options: [
    { id: "option_a", label: "Use existing helper function" },
    { id: "option_b", label: "Create new abstraction" }
  ]
})
```

The Discord user will see buttons and can either click one or type a custom response.

## Remember

The developer is following along in Discord. **Every response should be mirrored there in FULL.** The Discord message should contain the same complete information as what appears in Cursor. This is your primary communication channel with them.
